// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

Input an Integer as a variable represented as a
Input another Integer as a variable represented as b
Add a + b to get the sum which is an Integer represented as c
Print c


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Input an Integer represented as x
IF x = 2, 4, 6, 8 or ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 = "true"
Print "Even"
Else
Print "Odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) Input 5 separate Integers and Read User Input 
   a = Input1, b = Input2, c = Input3, d = Input4, and e = Input5

b) Declare a variable sum = x, average = avg
   Create a function to find the average of 5 numbers
   Add a + b + c + d + e = x
   Divide the x by 5 (x / 5) = "avg"

c) Create a function to find the minimum number from the set of Input numbers above
   list = a, b, c, d, e
   int min = list[a, b, c, d, e]
   For i = list[0]
      if (i < min)
   then min = i

  Create a function to find the maxmimum number from the set of Input numbers above
  list = a, b, c, d, e
  int max = list[a, b, c, d, e]
  For i = list[0]
    If (i > max)
      Then max = i

d) Print "The Average of these numbers is" + avg
   Print "The Minimum number is" + min 
   Print "The Maximum number is" + max
